## ESG Stock and Crypto Clustering  
 
### A tool for clustering stocks and cryptocurrencies, comparing their ESG scores vs. risk / return metrics.  
 
ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) investing has become a very important tool for those seeking to invest in companies that are, or seeking to become, more conscious of their impact in these areas.  This tool is designed to cluster stocks with similar risk / returns metrics and compare their ESG scores along with their return profiles.  We have also included two **cryptocurrencies** (Ethereum and Bitcoin) to our clusters.  While crypto investing has become extraordinarily popular, there are concerns about crypto mining's impact on the environment.  Theoretically these impacts could be mitigated by shifting other asset allocation to more environmentally friendly ones. By utilizing KMeans clustering, ESG scores, and historical price data for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 stocks, we can investigate and visualize the possibilities of enhancing the ESG impacts of assets within those indices.

**Note:** In this application we focus on environment scores, but these methods could easily be applied to social or governance scores.
